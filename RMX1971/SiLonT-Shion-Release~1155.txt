-- Notes --

Hi! So I did say Ame was going to be the last release until source for RUI 2.0 is up.
But turns out, Ame had a few critical bugs that I missed during my testing. Sorry for that ;-;.
So this time, i've made sure that all the issues that are reported are adressed, including video playback, which was pretty bad.
This release also includes improvements to the Simple LMK driver.
Additionally, I've removed some debugging messages that are redundant and audit is now disabled.

For those who are interested, you can check the full list of change on our GitHub repository :

That's it for today's release note, if you find any issue or want to give a suggestion, feel free to contact me on Telegram @naogairu
Stay save, have a good day! :D
