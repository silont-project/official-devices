### Short Predicted QnA:
1. Q: why no uclamp?
    A: the benefit of uclamp depends on kernel scheduler.
         In my case, it give very bad result (even worse than without uclamp shit)

2. Q: What is Efficient freq?
     A: you will see 1400mhz as your minimum cpu frequency
          and kernel will use fewer freq step (still give good enough battery)
 
 3. Q: Why took so long time?
      A: reason is
           1. School
           2. Some problem on real life
           3. busy with my minecraft world lmao
