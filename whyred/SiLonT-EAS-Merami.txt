### Short Predicted QnA:
1. Q: What is Efficient freq?
     A: Efficient freq means: using most efficient frequencya A frequency that gives good performance but not sacrificing the batterry life.
          you will see 1400mhz as your minimum cpu frequency
          and kernel will use fewer freq step (still give good enough battery)

2. Q: OC Sur!! when????
